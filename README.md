Fizzbuzz using springboot Restful web service and TDD testing 
####################################
There are 5 steps in the TDD flow:
-Read, understand, and process the feature or bug request.
-Translate the requirement by writing a unit test. If you have hot reloading set up, the unit test will run and fail as no code is implemented yet.
-Write and implement the code that fulfills the requirement. Run all tests and they should pass, if not repeat this step.
-Clean up your code by refactoring.
-Rinse, lather and repeat.
