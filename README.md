### There are 5 steps in the ``TDD flow``:

1. Read, understand, and process the feature or bug request.
2. Translate the requirement by writing a unit test. If you have hot reloading set up, the unit test will run and fail as no code is implemented yet.
3. Write and implement the code that fulfills the requirement. Run all tests and they should pass, if not repeat this step.
4. Clean up your code by refactoring.
5. Rinse, lather and repeat.
